This dataset has been scrapped off sa.aqar.fm to obtain land information such as price, size, street width, and locations. The uncleaned dataset scrapped 4347 rows, but seems like 1395 were duplicated and deleted. Leaving us with 2952 rows. The majority of the data is unfortunately lands based in Riyadh, but there are a good number of lands in Jeddah and Khobar. The dataset is set in Arabic, and decided to keep it that way to keep the integrity of the data. However, the street width, land size, and price have all been converted to numerical values, leaving some of those values as null if couldn't convert them.
